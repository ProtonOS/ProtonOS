## 7. Exception Handling

### Infrastructure (implemented)

- ✅ EH clause detection in Tier0JIT
- ✅ Exception type resolution (well-known types forwarded from System.Runtime to korlib)
- ✅ Unwind codes for all JIT methods (AddStandardUnwindCodes)
- ✅ LeaveTargetOffset encoding/decoding for funclet return addresses

### Basic Try/Catch
- ✅ try { } catch { } - basic catch-all
- ✅ try { } catch (Exception) { } - typed catch clause
- ✅ Multiple catch blocks - tested with 2 typed catches + catch-all
- ✅ Nested try/catch - tested with inner/outer try-catch

### Finally
- ✅ try { } finally { } - finally handler executes on normal and exceptional paths
- ✅ try { } catch { } finally { } - two-pass exception handling
- ✅ finally with return/break - leave instruction handling in finally (tested with break in loop)

### Throw
- ✅ throw new Exception() - exception allocation and dispatch
- ✅ rethrow (re-raise current exception)
- ✅ throw in catch block (new exception from catch handler)

### Filter
- ⚠️ catch when (condition) - infrastructure exists (ExecuteFilterFunclet), untested

### Fault
- ⚠️ fault blocks - treated like finally, untested

### Implementation Details
- Two-pass exception dispatch: Pass 1 finds handler, Pass 2 executes finally handlers
- Funclet calling convention: RCX = exception object, RDX = parent frame pointer
- Catch funclet prologue: `push rbp; mov rbp, rdx; push rcx` - establishes frame and pushes exception to eval stack
- Finally/fault funclet prologue: `push rbp; mov rbp, rdx` - no exception on stack
- Leave in funclet: `pop rbp; ret` - returns to LeaveTargetOffset (code after try/catch)
- Stack setup for funclet: RSP-16 with return address at RSP+8

---

5. ✅ Static constructors - cctor invocation working
6. Complex generics

### P2 - Nice to Have
7. Multi-dimensional arrays
8. Reflection basics
9. Overflow checking

---

## Test File Locations

Tests should be added to `src/FullTest/Program.cs` in appropriate test classes:

- `ExceptionTests` - Exception handling
- `InterfaceTests` - Interface dispatch
- `DelegateTests` - Delegates and function pointers
- `NullableTests` - Nullable<T> operations
- `StaticCtorTests` - Static constructor behavior
- `AdvancedGenericTests` - Complex generic scenarios

---

## Notes

- Current test count: 179 passing
- Target: Add ~50-100 more targeted tests before driver work
- Focus on failure isolation - each test should test ONE thing

## Recent Updates

### Catch Handler Funclet Fix (2024-12)
Fixed exception propagation from catch handlers (throw inside catch block):
- Bug: Catch funclets didn't push exception object (RCX) onto eval stack
- IL handler starts with `pop` to discard exception, but funclet had nothing to pop
- This caused `add rsp, 8` to corrupt the stack layout (shifting return address)
- Fix: Catch funclets now emit `push rcx` after prolog and track exception on eval stack
- TestNestedTryCatch now passes (throw from inner catch to outer catch)

### Nullable<T> Lifted Operators (2024-12)
Verified lifted operators work without additional JIT changes:
- C# compiler generates inline code using HasValue, GetValueOrDefault(), and newobj
- 11 new tests added for lifted operators:
  - Addition with both values, first null, second null, both null
  - Subtraction, multiplication, division
  - Equality comparisons (same values, different values, both null, one null)

### Nullable<T> Boxing/Unboxing (2024-12)
Completed Nullable<T> boxing/unboxing support:
- Nullable boxing: if HasValue is false, box returns null; if true, boxes inner T value
- Nullable unboxing: null reference creates Nullable with HasValue=false; non-null creates HasValue=true
- Added `IsNullable` flag (0x00010000) to MTFlags and MethodTable
- Added `IsNullableName()` and `IsNullableGenericDef()` helpers to AssemblyLoader
- `CompileBox` detects Nullable<T> and calls `CompileNullableBox` for special handling
- `CompileUnboxAny` detects Nullable<T> and calls `CompileNullableUnbox` for special handling
- Fixed multi-slot struct handling in box: LEA RSP instead of POP for structs >8 bytes
- 7 new tests added:
  - Boxing with value, boxing null, boxing default-constructed
  - Unboxing from boxed int, unboxing from null
  - Round-trip boxing/unboxing with value and null

### Nullable<T> Support (2024-12)
Added Nullable<T> support:
- Added `GetValueOrDefault()` and `GetValueOrDefault(T)` to korlib Nullable<T>
- Added `Nullable<T>` struct to System.Runtime to match korlib
- Fixed `newobj` for value types: properly allocate/zero large structs (>8 bytes)
- Fixed generic instantiation size calculation: compute Nullable<T> as 8 + sizeof(T)
- 13 tests passing (up from 9):
  - Constructor, HasValue, Value properties
  - GetValueOrDefault with/without custom default
  - Implicit conversion, null assignment (initobj)
  - Parameter passing and return values (fixed)

### Interface Dispatch (2024-12)
Implemented interface dispatch via `callvirt` on interface types:
- Added `IsInterfaceMethod()` / `IsMethodDefInterfaceMethod()` to detect interface method calls
- Added `CountInterfacesForType()` / `PopulateInterfaceMap()` to build interface maps in MethodTables
- Added `RegisterNewVirtualMethodsForLazyJit()` to register interface implementations for lazy JIT
- Modified `GetInterfaceMethod()` to call `EnsureVtableSlotCompiled()` for lazy compilation
- Test: `InterfaceTests.TestSimpleInterface()` - IValue interface with ValueImpl implementation

### Multiple Interfaces Fix (2024-12)
Fixed interface method argument count parsing:
- Interface methods were hardcoded to `ArgCount = 0` causing wrong argument counts
- Added signature parsing for MemberRef (cross-assembly) and MethodDef interface methods
- `ParseMemberRefSignatureForDelegate()` now shared for both delegates and interface methods
- Added `ParseMethodDefSignature()` for MethodDef interface method tokens
- 3 new tests: TestMultipleInterfacesFirst/Second/Third with IValue, IMultiplier, IAdder interfaces

### Static Constructor Support (2024-12)
Implemented static constructor (.cctor) invocation:
- `EnsureCctorContextRegistered()` finds and compiles cctors, registers context
- Context registered BEFORE compiling cctor to prevent infinite recursion when cctor accesses own type's fields
- `EmitCctorCheck()` generates inline code: load context, check if zero, if not zero clear and call
- `FindTypeCctor()` locates .cctor method for a TypeDef token
- cctor context stored as `StaticClassConstructionContext` with single `cctorMethodAddress` field
- Address=0 means "already run" or "being run", non-zero means "needs to run"
- 4 tests added:
  - TestStaticCtorInitializesField - cctor sets field to 42
  - TestStaticCtorRunsOnce - cctor only runs once across multiple accesses
  - TestStaticCtorOnWrite - writing to static field triggers cctor first
  - TestStaticCtorWithDependency - cctor with dependency on another type's static

### Finally in Loop Fix (2024-12)
Fixed stack corruption in finally handlers called from loops:
- Bug 1: Missing shadow space allocation when calling finally funclets from `leave`
  - The finally funclet's shadow space was overwriting caller's stack data
  - Fix: Added `sub rsp, 32` before call and `add rsp, 32` after in `CompileLeave()`
- Bug 2: Wrong local allocation formula in `CompileWithFunclets()`
  - Used `_localCount * 8 + 64` instead of `_localCount * 64 + 64`
  - This caused stack underallocation for methods with 3+ locals and EH clauses
  - Fix: Changed formula to match regular `Compile()` path (64 bytes per local)
- Symptom: Loop variable `i` showed corrupted values (e.g., 1066888 instead of 0,1,2)
- Test: `TestFinallyInLoopWithBreak` - finally runs on each loop iteration including break

### Interface Casting Tests (2024-12)
Added tests for isinst/castclass with interface types:
- TestIsinstInterfaceSuccess - object implements interface, returns object
- TestIsinstInterfaceFailure - object doesn't implement interface, returns null
- TestIsinstNull - null input returns null
- TestIsinstMultipleFirst/Second - isinst with multiple interfaces, then call through result
- TestCastclassInterfaceSuccess - explicit cast to interface type
